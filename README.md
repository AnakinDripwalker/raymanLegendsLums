# raymanLegendsLums
Little script to get Lums easily, by using creatures and changing date (you might want to check your system date gets back to normal once you're done with the script).

You should get around 80 lums / second.

press b to start the script, and s to stop it.

I made a short video to show what it does here : https://youtu.be/S6RKJ5pKPpc

Be sure that your computer uses windows.
